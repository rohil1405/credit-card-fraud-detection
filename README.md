# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection using Decision tree,XGBoost Classifier and Support vector machine.

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for this research is collected from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.

- The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

- It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

## Introduction

- 'Fraud' in credit card transactions is unauthorized and unwanted usage of an account by someone other than the owner of that account.
- Necessary prevention measures can be taken to stop this abuse and the behavior of such fraudulent practices can be studied to minimize it and protect against similar occurrences in the future.
- Fraud detection involves monitoring the activities of populations of users in order to estimate, perceive or avoid objectionable behaviour, which consist of fraud, intrusion, and defaulting.

## Problem Statement and Proposed system

- The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud. 
- This model is then used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. 
- The approach that this project proposes, uses the latest machine learning algorithms to detect anomalous activities, called outliers. 
- Our aim here is to detect 100% of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.
- Our Project’s main purpose is making Credit Card Fraud Detection, awaring to people from credit card online frauds. the main reason of credit card fraud detection system is necessary to safe our transactions & security.
